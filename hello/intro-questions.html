                    <h1>Intro Questions - Anthony Huang</h1>
        <p>1. Anthony Huang, CS+ Design, Freshman</p>
        <p>2. My passion to be an HCI designer prompted me to join this class. I also look forward to further developing my software development skills.</p>
        <p>3. I self-learned HTML when I was in high school. I am not proficient but I understand the basics.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to develop more advanced software development skills and incorprate them with my design background</p>
        <p>5. Designing on screens require consideration of interactivity, such as clicks, taps, scrolling, and responsive layouts for different devices.</p>
        <p>6. Good Design: 
            <a href="https://panomebio.com/" target="_blank">visit panomebio</a>
            I consider it to be a good site because I participated in the development, design, and optimization of the website.
        </p>
        <p>7.Effective Communication:
            <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">visit squarespace</a>
            It provides lots of modules and templates that miniziize my designing process. As a designer, I can also code in effects when I am not satisfied with the given modlues.
        </p>
        <p>8. Works WEll:
            <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas">Visit Canvas</a>
            Wow, it never creashes and it is very user-friendly. I really wish it doesn't work so accurate, so I can get away when I trun in my assigments seconds late.

							The first version of the typeface (<small>which later became known as Helvetica</small>) was designed in 1956 by Max Miedinger with art direction by Eduard Hoffmann. His goal was to design a new sans serif typeface that could compete in the Swiss market as a neutral face that should not be given any additional meaning. The main influence on Helvetica was
							<span>Akzidenz-Grotesk</span> from <span>Berthold</span>; Hoffman's scrapbook of proofs of the design shows careful comparison of test proofs with snippets of Akzidenz-Grotesk. Its 'R' with a curved tail resembles
							<strong>Schelter-Grotesk</strong>, another turn-of-the-century sans-serif sold by Haas. Wolfgang Homola comments that in Helvetica "the weight of the stems of the capitals and the lower case is better balanced" than in its influences.
						</li>

							Attracting considerable attention on its release as Neue Haas Grotesk (<small>Nouvelle Antique Haas in French-speaking countries</small>), Stempel and
							<span>Linotype</span> adopted Neue Haas Grotesk for release in
							<span>hot metal composition</span>, the standard typesetting method at the time for
							<span>body text</span>, and on the international market.

							In 1960, <span>Stempel</span> (<small>the German parent company of Haas</small>) changed the typeface's name to Helvetica, to make it more marketable internationally; it comes from the Latin name for the
							<span>pre-Roman tribes</span> of what became Switzerland. Intending to match the success of
							<span>Univers</span>, Arthur Ritzel of Stempel redesigned Neue Haas Grotesk into a larger typeface family.The design was popular:
							<span>Paul Shaw</span> suggests that Helvetica "began to muscle out" Akzidenz-Grotesk in New York City from around summer 1965, when Amsterdam Continental, which imported European typefaces, stopped pushing Akzidenz-Grotesk in its marketing and began to focus on Helvetica instead.
						</li>

							It was also made available for <span>phototypesetting</span> systems, as well as in other formats such as
							<span>Letraset</span>dry transfers and plastic letters, and many phototypesetting imitations and knock-offs were rapidly created by competing phototypesetting companies. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Linotype licensed Helvetica to
							<span>Xerox</span>, <span>Adobe</span> and <span>Apple</span>, guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core
							<span>computer fonts</span> of the <span>PostScript</span> page description language. This led to a version being included on Macintosh computers, with
							<span>Arial</span> (<small>a metrically compatible clone</small>) included with Microsoft Windows computers. The rights to Helvetica are now held by
							<span>Monotype Imaging</span>, which acquired Linotype; the Neue Haas Grotesk digitisation
							(<small>discussed below</small>) was co-released with Font Bureau.

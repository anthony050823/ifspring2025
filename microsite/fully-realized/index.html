							<b>Helvetica</b>, also known by its original name
							<b>Neue Haas Grotesk</b>, is a widely-used
							<span>sans-serif typeface</span> developed in 1957 by Swiss
							<span> typeface designer Max Miedinger</span> and Eduard Hoffmann.
						</li>
						<li>
							Helvetica is a
							<span>neo-grotesque</span> design, one influenced by the famous 19th-century
							(<small>1890s</small>) typeface
							<span>Akzidenz-Grotesk</span> and other German and Swiss designs.Its use became a hallmark of the
							<span> International Typographic Style</span> that emerged from the work of Swiss designers in the 1950s and 1960s, becoming one of the most popular typefaces of the mid-20th century.Over the years, a wide range of variants have been released in different weights, widths, and sizes, as well as matching designs for a range of non-Latin alphabets. Notable features of Helvetica as originally designed include a high
							<span>x-height</span>, the termination of strokes on horizontal or vertical lines and an unusually tight spacing between letters, which combine to give it a dense, solid appearance.

								Developed by the Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei (<small>Haas Type Foundry</small>) of
								<span>Münchenstein</span> (<small>Basel</small>), Switzerland, its release was planned to match a trend: a resurgence of interest in turn-of-the-century "grotesque" sans-serifs among European graphic designers, that also saw the release of
								<span>Univers</span> by <span>Adrian Frutiger</span> the same year. Hoffmann was the president of the Haas Type Foundry, while Miedinger was a freelance graphic designer who had formerly worked as a Haas salesman and designer.
							</li>
							<li>
								Originally named Neue Haas Grotesk (<small>New Haas Grotesque</small>), it was soon licensed by Linotype and renamed Helvetica in 1960, which in
								<span>Latin</span> means 'Swiss', from <span>Helvetia</span>,capitalising on Switzerland's reputation as a centre of ultra-modern graphic design.

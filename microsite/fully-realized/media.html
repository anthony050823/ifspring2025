								An early essay on Helvetica's public image as a tyepface used by business and government was written in 1976 by Leslie Savan, a writer on advertising at the
								<span>Village Voice</span>. It was later republished in her book The Sponsored life.

							In 2007, director <span>Gary Hustwit</span> released a documentary film, <span>Helvetica</span>
							(<small>Plexifilm</small>, <small>DVD</small>), to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the typeface. In the film, graphic designer
							<span>Wim Crouwel</span> said, "Helvetica was a real step from the 19th century typeface... We were impressed by that because it was more neutral, and neutralism was a word that we loved. It should be neutral. It shouldn't have a meaning in itself. The meaning is in the content of the text and not in the typeface." The documentary also presented other designers who associated Helvetica with authority and corporate dominance, and whose rebellion from Helvetica's ubiquity created new styles.

					<li>From April 2007 to March 2008, the <span>Museum of Modern Art</span> in New York City displayed an exhibit called "50 Years of Helvetica". In 2011 the Disseny Hub Barcelona displayed an exhibit called Helvetica. A New Typeface?. The exhibition included a timeline of Helvetica over the last fifty years, its antecedents and its subsequent influence, including in the local area.</li>

						In 2011, one of Google's <span>April Fools' Day</span> jokes centered on the use of Helvetica. If a user attempted to search for the term "Helvetica" using the search engine, the results would be displayed in
						<span>Comic Sans</span>.
